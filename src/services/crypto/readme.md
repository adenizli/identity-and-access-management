This module provides a standardized and secure approach for encrypting and decrypting sensitive data within the system. It leverages strong cryptographic algorithms (such as AES-256-GCM) and manages encryption keys via environment configuration, ensuring both data confidentiality and integrity. Use the CryptoService to seamlessly protect and retrieve confidential information across all modules.
