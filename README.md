## üéØ Project Overview

This IAM system implements core identity and access management functionalities with a focus on **security**, **scalability**, and **maintainability**. Built using modern development patterns and current technologies, it demonstrates practical implementation of user authentication, authorization, and identity management concepts.

### Why NestJS?

We chose **NestJS** over Express for this application because:

- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Closer adherence to OOP principles for better code organization

- **Service Documentation**: Individual `_docs/architecture.md` in each service folder
- **Module Documentation**: Detailed architecture docs in each module

## üéì Development Approach

This project was developed with a focus on **learning and best practices**:

- **AI-Assisted Reviews**: Used Claude Code as a **review tool and mentor**, not as a replacement for engineering decisions
- **Educational Focus**: AI served as a teacher to identify gaps and improvement opportunities
- **Manual Implementation**: All code written manually. We did not prefer AI to directly have control over our codes. It just provided guidance and feedback
- **Best Practices**: Emphasis on learning enterprise-grade development patterns

This approach ensures genuine understanding of the technologies and patterns while leveraging AI as an educational tool rather than a complete engineering replacement.

## üîÆ Future Development

The system is designed for extensibility. As time permits, planned enhancements include:

- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) implementation
- Single Sign-On (SSO) integration
- Advanced audit logging and compliance features
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Comprehensive test suite with high coverage
